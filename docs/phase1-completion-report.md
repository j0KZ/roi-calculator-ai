## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Process Management Architecture
```
User Request → start.sh → ProcessManager
                             ↓
                    Check Single Instance
                             ↓
                    Kill Zombies if Exist
                             ↓
                    Start Streamlit Process
                             ↓
                    Monitor Health (30s intervals)
                             ↓
                    Auto-restart if Unhealthy
```

### Caching Architecture
```
Request → Cache Manager → Redis (if available)
                ↓              ↓ (fallback)
            Cache Hit?     In-Memory Cache
                ↓              
         Yes: Return    No: Execute & Cache
```

### Monitoring Flow
```
Operation → Performance Monitor → Track Metrics
                                      ↓
                              Store in History
                                      ↓
                              Detect Bottlenecks
                                      ↓
                              Export Reports
```
