### 2. **Assessment Tool Page**  
- **Problem**: Missing session state and RapidAssessmentTool initialization
- **Solution**: Added complete session state setup including assessment tool instance
- **Fix**: Page now runs independently with proper state management

### 3. **Proposal Generator Page**

## üìã Changes Made

### All Three Pages Updated:
```python
# Added to each page before the main function:
if 'client_data' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.client_data = {...}
if 'assessment_results' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.assessment_results = {}
if 'roi_results' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.roi_results = {}
# Plus page-specific state variables

# Added at the end of each file:
show_[page_name]()  # Execute the page function
```
